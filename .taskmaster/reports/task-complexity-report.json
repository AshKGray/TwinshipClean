			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Twin Pairing and Invitation System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the twin pairing system implementation into: 1) Pairing code generation with uniqueness validation and 24-hour expiration, 2) REST API endpoints for invitation lifecycle (create, retrieve, accept, cancel), 3) QR code generation using react-native-qrcode-svg and scanning with expo-camera, 4) Frontend service updates to replace mock implementations with real API calls, and 5) Analytics dashboard for tracking invitation metrics and success rates.",
			"reasoning": "Found existing invitationService.ts with comprehensive mock implementation (300+ lines) already defining interfaces and logic. Service includes token generation, rate limiting, and analytics tracking. Need to replace mock with real API endpoints, add QR code functionality using existing expo-image packages, and integrate with backend. Existing PairScreen.tsx already handles TEST/TESTTWIN codes. Moderate complexity due to existing foundation."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Research Telemetry Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement research telemetry system with: 1) Database schema design for telemetry storage with proper data isolation and retention policies, 2) GDPR-compliant consent management with versioning and audit trails, 3) Event collection endpoints with batching and rate limiting, 4) Comprehensive data anonymization using HMAC pseudonymization and k-anonymity, and 5) Research data export functionality with multiple formats and webhook integration.",
			"reasoning": "Found existing telemetryService.ts with 500+ lines implementing privacy-first telemetry collection, anonymization, and batching. researchService.ts also exists with consent management. Complex due to GDPR requirements, data anonymization needs, and separation of telemetry from user data. Requires careful database design, privacy protection, and integration with existing services."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Bundle Size Reduction",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Optimize app performance through: 1) Bundle analysis and dependency audit to remove 49 unused packages already identified, 2) Code splitting with React.lazy() for heavy screens like games and assessments, 3) Image optimization using expo-image with progressive loading and caching, 4) Component memoization and Zustand store optimization, and 5) Startup sequence optimization with deferred initialization and performance monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "Status is in-progress with subtask 1 completed. Already removed 49 unused dependencies. AppNavigator.tsx already implements lazy loading with lazyWithPreload utility. expo-image is installed. 175 TypeScript files to optimize. Moderate complexity due to existing lazy loading infrastructure and completed dependency audit."

		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement E2E Testing with Detox",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Setup comprehensive E2E testing with: 1) Detox framework installation and configuration for iOS/Android with proper build settings, 2) Core user flow tests for onboarding, pairing, chat, premium, and assessments, 3) Test data fixtures and cleanup utilities for consistent test execution, 4) CI/CD pipeline integration with parallel execution and artifact collection, and 5) Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "No existing Detox setup found in package.json. Project has 175+ TypeScript files and complex navigation with lazy loading. Need to test multiple critical flows across authentication, pairing, chat, games, and assessments. High complexity due to React Native/Expo setup, platform-specific testing, and CI integration requirements."

		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Production Deployment and Monitoring Setup",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Configure production infrastructure with: 1) Cloud infrastructure setup on AWS/GCP with auto-scaling, load balancing, and CloudFlare CDN, 2) Monitoring with Sentry error tracking and Mixpanel/Amplitude analytics integration, 3) Push notifications via FCM/APNS and feature flag system for gradual rollouts, 4) App store submissions with all required assets and metadata, and 5) Backup, disaster recovery, and customer support system implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Found existing CI/CD workflows in .github/workflows including production-deploy.yml, staging-deploy.yml, and deployment-monitor.yml. Complex due to multi-platform deployment (iOS/Android), infrastructure requirements for 10k concurrent users, multiple third-party integrations, and app store compliance. Requires coordination across cloud services, monitoring tools, and support systems."
