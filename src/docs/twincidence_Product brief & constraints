Product brief & constraints 
The new Twinship module is called “Twincidences.”
Goal:
	•	Log “twin moments” (manual + detected).
	•	Give per-signal, per-twin controls for: Collect locally, Share with my twin, Include in anonymized research.
	Revised Dual-Consent Rule (for Twincidences)
		•	Consent is granted up front, the first time a user opens the Twincidences log. The app presents each detectable event type one by one with plain-language explanations, and the user chooses one of three options:
			A. Allow anonymous collection for research only (background aggregation, never linked to identity).
			B. Allow this event type to be recorded and shared with my twin as an alert (requires my twin’s matching consent).
			C. Do not allow this event type to be collected, stored, or shared in any form.
		•	At any time, a user can open Settings and change their choices (pause, revoke, or re-enable for each event type).
		•	Dual-consent check:
		•	If both twins select “B” for an event type, that event can generate a shared Twincidence alert.
		•	If one selects “B” and the other selects “C,” the “C” (no consent) overrides and no data is shared or collected.
		•	If one selects “B” and the other selects “A,” then only anonymous, aggregated data is uploaded for research; no twin-to-twin alert is created.
		•	Summary: Sharing with a twin requires both twins’ explicit prior consent. Research data can still be collected if at least one twin opts for “A,” but twin-to-twin sharing is always blocked unless both choose “B.”
	•	Default = everything OFF until the user opts in.
	•	Computation on-device by default; sync minimal metadata for shared alerts.
	•	iOS/SwiftUI; HealthKit for HR/sleep/steps (read-only, least privilege).
	•	No ads. No sale of data. Provide Pause All, Delete All, Export JSON.

Deliverables for this phase:
	1.	Swift models & storage scaffold.
	2.	Consent Matrix UI (toggle grid + explanations).
	3.	Twintuition simultaneity detector (no HealthKit).
	4.	Manual “+ Log Twincidence.”
	5.	Push notifications pipeline honoring dual consent.
	6.	Config-driven catalog for event types & thresholds.

Make the architecture modular so future detectors (HR/sleep/media) are plug-ins.
